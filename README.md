# Simple Ray Tracer
Simple ray tracer written in Rust. 

### Project Status
This project is currently in pre-release. It has basic ray tracer functionality. 
There is no external software integration. All meshes, objects, and materials have to be tediously added by hand. 


Also, there is way to save a scene to an external file, it's all saved in code. 

### Use
Though not currently very user friendly, it is usable. I've included four example scenes, stored in functions in the `src/main.rs`.

### Included Examples
* test: a simple test scene
* diffuse: a demo showing Phong shading capabilities
* reflection: a demo demonstrating a scene with some simple reflections
* demo_complex: a more complicated example with lots of reflections, lights, and spheres
